 **Abstract**

This study employed various computational methods to analyze a DNA sequence to find potential protein-coding regions and predict protein properties. The analysis revealed four potential open reading frames (ORFs) and predicted a protein with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 8.70 and a molecular weight (Mw) of 17424.08 Da. Additionally, a hydropathy plot provided insights into the protein's potential interaction with water.

## Methodology & Tools Used

The following bioinformatics tools were utilized to analyze the sequence:

* 
**ORF Finder:** Used to identify Open Reading Frames.


* 
**Signal P 4.1:** Used for signal peptide prediction.


* 
**Primer 3:** Used for primer design.


* 
**Expasy Translate & ProtParam:** Used to translate sequences and calculate physicochemical properties.


* 
**CCD (Conserved Domain Database):** Used to identify conserved domains.


* 
**Hydropathy Plot:** Used to analyze hydrophobicity.


* 
**NEb Cutter:** Used for restriction enzyme analysis.


* 
**BLAST:** Used to find similar sequences and top hits.


* 
**PEP DRAW:** Used to visualize peptide structure and reverse compliments.



## Key Findings

### 1. Sequence Statistics

* The input was a 498 bp linear sequence.


* The sequence composition was calculated as 38% GC content and 62% AT content.



### 2. Protein Characterization

* 
**ORFs:** The analysis identified four potential open reading frames, with the largest spanning nucleotides 182-391.


* 
**Physicochemical Properties:** The predicted protein has a theoretical pI of 8.70 and a molecular weight of 17424.08 Da.


* 
**Conserved Domains:** The analysis identified a conserved domain, HUP A, suggesting a potential role in stress response.


* 
**Signal Peptide:** A signal peptide was predicted with a cleavage site between positions 16 and 17.



### 3. Structural and Functional Analysis

* 
**Hydropathy:** Hydropathy analysis suggested the protein's interaction with water based on the hydrophobicity of amino acids in the sequence.



**Restriction Enzymes:**The DNA sequence is cuttable by 19 different restriction enzymes, including both frequent and rare cutters, which aids in cloning.



## Conclusion

These findings offer a preliminary characterization of the protein encoded by the DNA sequence and provide data to guide further research.
